.SYNOPSIS
    Run a live_test_* script against a throwaway Uptime Kuma container on a
    remote Docker host, then destroy the container.

.DESCRIPTION
    Some verification can only be done against a real server: whether a version
    gate is correct, what a server does with a field the library withholds, how a
    payload round-trips. This starts a disposable container for exactly that, runs
    one script against it, and removes it again.

    Two properties are the point of it existing rather than doing this by hand.

    1. The container is destroyed in a finally block, including on the path where
       the script raised or readiness timed out. A forgotten container on a shared
       host holding a bound port is the failure mode this prevents.
    2. The Docker host address and SSH user are read from the gitignored root
       .env and are NEVER printed. Every line of output passes through a
       sanitizer that replaces them with the <docker-host> and <user>
       placeholders, so a captured transcript can be pasted into an issue or a
       spec without scrubbing.

    The container runs with no volume, so removing it destroys all of its state.
    It is bootstrapped by the script under test -- need_setup() / setup() / login()
    -- with a password this runner generates per run rather than a committed one.

.PARAMETER Script
    The script to run, relative to the repository root. Must exist.

.PARAMETER Image
    Container image. Defaults to the 1.23.2 image used for v1 verification.

.PARAMETER Port
    Host port to publish on. Defaults to 3023. Port 3001 is refused outright --
    see the note in the code.

.PARAMETER Name
    Container name. Defaults to kuma-disposable-<port>.

.PARAMETER Username
    Admin username to bootstrap with. Defaults to admin.

.PARAMETER Password
    Admin password to bootstrap with. Defaults to a freshly generated value.
    Uptime Kuma requires at least 6 characters.

.PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
    How long to wait for the container to answer before giving up. Defaults to
    120. On timeout the container is removed and the runner exits non-zero.

.PARAMETER KeepContainer
    Leave the container running after the script finishes, for debugging. You are
    then responsible for removing it. The name is printed so you can.

.PARAMETER Python
    Python executable. Defaults to the repository virtualenv.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -File scripts/run_disposable_kuma.ps1 -Script tests/live_test_v2_only_fields_v1.py

    Probe every version-gated monitor field against a 1.23.2 server. This is the
    run recorded in .kiro/specs/v2-only-fields-rule/v1-verification-results.md.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -File scripts/run_disposable_kuma.ps1 `
        -Script tests/live_test_conditions_v1.py -Port 3024

    A second script on a different port, so it can run alongside the first.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -File scripts/run_disposable_kuma.ps1 `
        -Script tests/live_test_status_page_analytics_v2_0.py `
        -Image louislam/uptime-kuma:2.0.2 -Port 3025 `
        -DockerEnv UPTIME_KUMA_DB_TYPE=sqlite

    A 2.x container. -Image has always accepted any tag; the two things a 2.x
    run needs beyond that are not obvious and cost an hour to rediscover:

    1. -DockerEnv UPTIME_KUMA_DB_TYPE=sqlite is REQUIRED. On first boot 2.x
       serves a "setup-database" screen and does not mount socket.io until a
       database type is chosen, so the client hangs on the handshake while
       /socket.io/ falls through to the SPA and answers 200 with HTML.
       Observed on 2.0.2: /api/entry-page returns {"type":"setup-database"}.

    2. The readiness check below waits for HTTP 200 on /, which 2.x answers
       before socket.io accepts. The script under test should retry its initial
       connection for a while rather than assuming PASS ready means connectable
       -- see connect_with_retry in live_test_status_page_analytics_v2_0.py.

.NOTES
    Requires the root .env to define DOCKER-HOST and DOCKER-USER, key-based SSH
    to that host, and Docker on it. This is maintainer tooling: scripts/ ships in
    neither the wheel nor the sdist, and CI never runs it.

    Output is ASCII only. The Windows console defaults to cp1252 and raises
    UnicodeEncodeError on check marks and box-drawing characters, which has
    crashed scripts mid-run here before. Use PASS / FAIL / ->.

    The script under test is expected to read UPTIME_KUMA_V1_URL,
    UPTIME_KUMA_V1_USERNAME and UPTIME_KUMA_V1_PASSWORD, which this runner sets
    for the child process only. Those keys are deliberately distinct from the
    UPTIME_KUMA_* keys in tests/.env that point at a real 2.x instance, so a
    script that creates and deletes monitors cannot reach it by misconfiguration.
    There is deliberately no option to change that prefix: making it settable
    would hand back exactly the accident the split key names exist to prevent.
