# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution to `uptime-kuma-api2`. This is a
maintained continuation of [`lucasheld/uptime-kuma-api`](https://github.com/lucasheld/uptime-kuma-api)
under the original MIT license.

## Project shape

- **Import package:** `uptime_kuma_api` (never renamed — existing user code
  depends on it). **PyPI name:** `uptime-kuma-api2`.
- Supports Uptime Kuma **1.21.3+ through 2.x from one codebase**. Server-
  version-specific behavior is gated behind `parse_version(self.version)`
  checks. The lowest gate in the code is `1.22`, so servers below that
  deliberately take the pre-1.22 payload path; 1.21.3 is the declared support
  floor, not the lowest branch.
- **Backward compatibility with v1.x is not negotiable.** A change that breaks
  a v1.x connection is a regression.

## Development setup

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate        # Windows;  source .venv/bin/activate elsewhere
pip install -e .
pip install pytest
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt   # only needed to build docs
```

## Running tests

Run the unit suite — no server required, this is what CI runs:

```
pytest -v
```

That is the whole command. There is no list of test files to keep in step:
`tests/conftest.py` marks a test `integration` when its class extends
`UptimeKumaTestCase` — the base class whose `setUp` connects to a server and
deletes everything on it — and `pytest.ini` deselects that marker by default.
Adding a test file therefore needs no change here, in the workflows, or in the
README. A new unit test runs because it does not extend that base class; a new
integration test is excluded because it does.

> **The integration tests delete all data on the instance they reach** —
> monitors, notifications, proxies, tags, status pages, docker hosts,
> maintenances and API keys — during setup. They are meant for a disposable
> instance such as a throwaway Docker container, never one you care about.
>
> A bare `pytest` no longer runs them, so the old footgun is closed by default.
> Running them is deliberate and explicit:
>
> ```
> pytest -m integration        # DESTRUCTIVE
> ```
>
> `./run_tests.sh` is the maintained way to do it safely: it creates and
> destroys its own containers per server version. It drives the tests through
> `unittest discover`, which ignores pytest markers, so it runs the full suite
> regardless of the default above.

### Live verification (optional, maintainer-scoped)

**A contribution does not need this.** The unit suite above requires no
configuration and is the whole of what CI runs.

Separately, `tests/live_test_*.py` are manual scripts that check round-trip
behaviour against a real Uptime Kuma instance. They are `live_test_`-prefixed so
pytest never collects them. They read their configuration from `tests/.env`:

```
cp tests/.env.example tests/.env    # then fill in your own values
```

`tests/.env.example` lists every key, which script consumes it, and what each is
for. `tests/.env` is gitignored and must stay that way.

These scripts **create and delete data** on whatever you point them at —
`live_test_cleanup.py` deletes monitors, notifications and status pages — so use
a disposable instance you own, and always run `live_test_cleanup.py --dry-run`
before the real thing.

If you have a Docker host to hand, `scripts/run_disposable_kuma.ps1` removes the
"disposable instance you own" problem: it starts a throwaway container, runs one
script against it, and destroys the container in a `finally` block even if the
script raises.

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/run_disposable_kuma.ps1 -Script tests/live_test_v2_only_fields_v1.py
```

The scripts prefixed `live_test_*_v1.py` are the odd ones out and read their own
`UPTIME_KUMA_V1_*` keys rather than the `tests/.env` ones, precisely so a script
that creates monitors cannot reach a 2.x instance by misconfiguration. The runner
sets those keys for the child process, so it needs no `tests/.env` at all. See
`scripts/README.md`.

## What we look for in a change

- **Reproduce before fixing.** Issue titles here often misdescribe the real
  defect — confirm the actual cause in the code first.
- **Every bug fix ships with a regression test** that is proven to fail against
  the unfixed code (revert the fix, watch it go red, restore).
- **Additive over breaking.** Prefer new optional parameters and new return
  keys over changing existing signatures or return shapes. When a server
  renames a field across versions, return both keys where feasible.
- **Keep the public API in sync:** export new public classes in `__init__.py`,
  add them to `docs/api.rst` (Sphinx autodoc won't include them otherwise), add
  a `MonitorBuilder` setter for new monitor fields, and add a `CHANGELOG.md`
  entry.

## Commit messages — Conventional Commits

First line: `<type>: <summary>`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`,
`refactor`, `chore`. Breaking changes use `!` (e.g. `feat!: drop Python 3.7`).
The type guides the version bump (fix → patch, feat → minor, breaking → major).

## Claiming an issue before you start

**Say on the issue that you want it, and it's yours.** A maintainer will add the
`claimed` label. Before starting on something, check whether that label is
already there — if it is, ask on the issue rather than opening a competing PR.

The label exists because GitHub only lets you assign issues to people with write
access to the repository, so an outside contributor who opened an issue cannot be
assigned to it. Adding someone as a collaborator just to mark a claim would be a
much bigger step than the claim warrants, so the label does that job instead.

There is no deadline attached to a claim, and no obligation once you have made
one. **If you get busy or it turns out to be more work than you expected, just
say so on the issue.** That is genuinely more useful than going quiet, because it
frees the issue up immediately. If a claimed issue does go quiet, a maintainer
will ask on the issue whether you are still interested and say plainly what
happens next, rather than silently taking it over.

Credit does not depend on who writes the final code. `CHANGELOG.md` credits
contributors by handle for the diagnosis as well as the fix — see the existing
`(credit: @handle, PR #n)` entries. If a maintainer or another contributor builds
on commits you have already pushed, that lands with a `Co-authored-by:` trailer.

## Pull requests

1. Work on a branch named `<type>/<short-description>`, where `<type>` is the
   Conventional Commit type of the change's main purpose (so any of the types
   listed above — e.g. `fix/...`, `docs/...`, `chore/...`). Never commit to
   `main`.
2. Open a PR against `main`; CI runs the full Python 3.8–3.13 matrix.
3. Fill in the PR checklist (tests, changelog, backward-compat, docs).
4. A maintainer merges after review.

`main` is branch-protected, so steps 1 and 2 are enforced rather than merely
asked for: a direct push is rejected, a pull request is required, and the full
Python 3.8–3.13 matrix must report green before the merge button unlocks.

## A note on AI-agent steering files

This repo commits AI-agent guidance under `.kiro/steering/`. Because those
files instruct coding agents, changes to them are reviewed with the same care
as code — treat a PR that edits steering as a code change, not a docs tweak.

## AI-assisted development

Development uses AI-assisted tooling. All output is reviewed by the maintainer
and verified against live Uptime Kuma instances before release.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Use the issue templates. For bugs, the Uptime Kuma **server version**, the
**library version**, and your **Python version** are required — most triage
time is lost without them.

## Security

Do not report security issues in public issues. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
