# uptime-kuma-api2

A wrapper for the Uptime Kuma Socket.IO API — with full v2 support
---

> **About this project:** uptime-kuma-api2 is an independent continuation of
> [lucasheld/uptime-kuma-api](https://github.com/lucasheld/uptime-kuma-api),
> the original library created by [Lucas Held](https://github.com/lucasheld).
> That project appears to be unmaintained — its last release was in 2023, and
> open issues and pull requests (including several adding Uptime Kuma 2.x
> support) have sat unreviewed and unmerged. Rather than leave 2.x users
> without a working library, this project carries the code forward with full
> v2.x support while keeping backward compatibility with v1.x.

> It began as a fork and is published under the original MIT license. Lucas

> **Naming:** the PyPI distribution is `uptime-kuma-api2`, while the import package remains `uptime_kuma_api` so existing code works unchanged. The similarly named PyPI projects `uptime-kuma-api` (the original) and `uptime-kuma-api-v2` (a different maintainer) are separate from this one. The repository was renamed from `uptime-kuma-api-v2` to `uptime-kuma-api2` to match the PyPI name; the old URL redirects automatically.

uptime-kuma-api2 is a Python wrapper for the [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) Socket.IO API.

This package was originally developed to configure Uptime Kuma with Ansible. The original Ansible collection can be found at https://github.com/lucasheld/ansible-uptime-kuma.

Python version 3.8+ is required. Tested on 3.8 through 3.13.

Supported Uptime Kuma versions:

| Uptime Kuma    | uptime-kuma-api2 |
|----------------|------------------|
| 1.21.3 - 2.5.0 | 2.3.0 - 2.6.0    |

One install covers both majors — there is no separate v1 line to pin to. Server-version-specific behaviour is gated at runtime, so the same package works against a 1.x and a 2.x server.

The range above is what the project tests against. The Docker matrix in `run_tests.sh` exercises the version gate boundaries across it — 1.21.3, 1.22.x, 1.23.x, 2.0.0, 2.1.0 and 2.5.0 — and this tree was additionally live-verified end to end against 1.23.2, 2.0.2 and 2.5.0.

Uptime Kuma older than 1.21.3 is **not** supported: that support was dropped in uptime-kuma-api 1.0.0. If you run one of those servers, use 0.13.0.

Earlier release lines, kept as a record of what each published version was documented to support:

| Uptime Kuma     | uptime-kuma-api2 |
|-----------------|------------------|
| 2.0.0 - 2.4.0   | 2.0.0 - 2.2.1    |
| 1.21.3 - 1.23.2 | 1.0.0 - 1.2.1    |
| 1.17.0 - 1.21.2 | 0.1.0 - 0.13.0   |

Releases 1.2.1 and earlier were published under the upstream `uptime-kuma-api` name; 2.0.0 onward are published as `uptime-kuma-api2`.

Installation
---
uptime-kuma-api2 is available on the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/uptime-kuma-api2/).

You can install it using pip:

```
pip install uptime-kuma-api2
```

Documentation
---
The API reference is published on [Read the Docs](https://uptime-kuma-api2.readthedocs.io).

You can also build it locally with Sphinx:

```
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
cd docs && make html
```

Note: [uptime-kuma-api.readthedocs.io](https://uptime-kuma-api.readthedocs.io) (without the `2`) is the *original* project's site and does not cover this project's v2 features.

Example
---
Once you have installed the python package, you can use it to communicate with an Uptime Kuma instance.

To do so, import `UptimeKumaApi` from the library and specify the Uptime Kuma server url (e.g. 'http://127.0.0.1:3001'), username and password to initialize the connection.

```python
>>> from uptime_kuma_api import UptimeKumaApi, MonitorType
>>> api = UptimeKumaApi('INSERT_URL')
>>> api.login('INSERT_USERNAME', 'INSERT_PASSWORD')
```

**Note on the Uptime Kuma "API key":** the *API key* you can create in the Uptime Kuma web UI is not a credential for this library. The UI "API key" cannot authenticate this socket.io API: it only grants access to Uptime Kuma's Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint. Authenticate with a username and password, or with a login token via `login_by_token()`.

Now you can call one of the existing methods of the instance. For example create a new monitor:

```python
>>> result = api.add_monitor(type=MonitorType.HTTP, name="Google", url="https://google.com")
>>> print(result)
{'msg': 'Added Successfully.', 'monitorID': 1}
```

At the end, the connection to the API must be disconnected so that the program does not block.

```python
>>> api.disconnect()
```

With a context manager, the disconnect method is called automatically:

```python
from uptime_kuma_api import UptimeKumaApi, MonitorType

with UptimeKumaApi('INSERT_URL') as api:
    api.login('INSERT_USERNAME', 'INSERT_PASSWORD')
    api.add_monitor(
        type=MonitorType.HTTP,
        name="Google",
        url="https://google.com"
    )
```

MonitorBuilder
---
For complex monitor configurations, use the fluent `MonitorBuilder`:

```python
from uptime_kuma_api import UptimeKumaApi, MonitorType, MonitorBuilder

with UptimeKumaApi('INSERT_URL') as api:
    api.login('INSERT_USERNAME', 'INSERT_PASSWORD')
    
    config = (
        MonitorBuilder()
        .type(MonitorType.HTTP)
        .name("My Monitor")
        .url("https://example.com")
        .interval(60)
        .conditions([
            {"type": "expression", "variable": "response_status", "operator": "==", "value": "200", "andOr": ""}
        ])
        .build()
    )
    result = api.add_monitor(**config)
    print(result)
```

What this adds over the original library
---
- **New monitor types**: RabbitMQ, SNMP, SMTP, System Service
- **New notification providers**: Nextcloud Talk, Brevo, Evolution API
- **MonitorBuilder**: Fluent builder pattern for monitor configuration
- **Logger support**: Pass a custom logger for Socket.IO debugging
- **v2-only parameters**: Automatic version gating ensures backward compatibility with v1.x
- **Fixes carried forward from the upstream tracker**, plus defects found by this project's own live verification against real 1.x and 2.x servers

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the release-by-release detail — this list is deliberately not versioned, so it does not go stale one release at a time.

Testing
---
The v2 unit tests need no live server, and are what a bare `pytest` runs. This is also exactly what CI runs:

```
pip install pytest
pytest -v
```

The remaining test files are integration tests inherited from upstream. They expect a live Uptime Kuma instance at `http://127.0.0.1:3001` and will **delete all monitors, notifications, proxies, tags, status pages, docker hosts, maintenances and API keys** on that instance, so never point them at a production server. They are excluded from a plain `pytest` run for that reason — opting in is explicit:

```
pytest -m integration     # DESTRUCTIVE: disposable instances only
```

The exclusion is not a list of filenames anyone maintains. `tests/conftest.py` marks a test `integration` when its class extends `UptimeKumaTestCase`, the base class whose `setUp` performs those deletions, and `pytest.ini` deselects that marker by default. So "needs a live server" is read off the code rather than restated, and adding a test file requires no change to CI, to the workflows, or to any command in this README.

The table below is coverage documentation, not a list anything executes — letting it fall behind degrades the docs, it cannot silently un-run a test.

Test files:

| File | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| `tests/test_monitor_types_v2.py` | New monitor types (RABBITMQ, SNMP, SMTP, SYSTEM_SERVICE) |

| `tests/test_monitor_cache_v2.py` | The 2.x `updateMonitorIntoList` / `deleteMonitorFromList` delta handlers and the refreshed `delete_monitor` / `delete_monitor_tag` guards |
