## Scratch files go in `.temp/`

Anything transient written into the working tree — a PR or issue body drafted for
`gh --body-file`, a probe script, captured command output — goes in `.temp/`,
which is gitignored as a whole. Create it if it isn't there.

Do not scatter temp files at the repo root. Nothing there is ignored by default,
so a file left behind shows up as untracked, `gh` warns about an uncommitted
change on every call, and it is one careless `git add` away from being committed.
`.temp/` makes a forgotten file harmless instead of a near miss, and it keeps the
draft openable in the editor for review, which a system temp directory would not.

Being gitignored does not make `.temp/` safe for secrets: treat it like
`tests/.backups/`, which is also ignored and still holds plaintext credentials.

## tests/ taxonomy — know which is which

The two categories are distinguished **mechanically**, not by a list anyone
maintains: a test needs a live server exactly when its class extends
`UptimeKumaTestCase`. `tests/conftest.py` marks those `integration` and
`pytest.ini` deselects that marker, so `pytest` is the unit suite and
`pytest -m integration` is the destructive one. Deliberately no filenames are
enumerated below — an earlier version of this section listed all nine unit files
and was one of seven copies that had to be edited in lockstep.

- **v2 unit tests** — every `tests/test_*.py` that does **not** extend
  `UptimeKumaTestCase`. No live server; they mock the version and transport.
  **This is the CI suite**, and what a bare `pytest` runs. Add regression tests
  here; no CI or docs change is needed when you do.
- **Inherited integration tests** — every `tests/test_*.py` that **does** extend
  `UptimeKumaTestCase` (`test_monitor.py`, `test_notification.py`,
  `test_status_page.py` and the rest). Require a live instance at
  `127.0.0.1:3001` and **wipe all its data** on setup. Never run in CI, and
  deselected from a plain `pytest`. Never point them at anything you care about.
- **Live scripts** (`live_test_backup.py`, `live_test_create.py`,
  `live_test_cleanup.py`, `live_test_ssl_verify.py`, `live_test_delete_id.py`):
  manual round-trip verification against a real 2.x instance, driven by
  `tests/.env`. Not tests, not run by CI. `live_test_ssl_verify.py` additionally
  needs an endpoint with a genuinely untrusted certificate, set via
  `UPTIME_KUMA_SELFSIGNED_URL`. `live_test_delete_id.py` creates and deletes one
  monitor, so point it at a disposable instance only.
- **v1 live scripts** (`live_test_conditions_v1.py`,
  `live_test_v2_only_fields_v1.py`, `live_test_status_page_v1.py`): the odd ones out — it targets
  a **disposable Uptime Kuma 1.23.x container**, not the 2.x instance the scripts
  above use, and it reads its own `UPTIME_KUMA_V1_URL` /
  `UPTIME_KUMA_V1_USERNAME` / `UPTIME_KUMA_V1_PASSWORD` keys rather than the
  `tests/.env` 2.x keys, so it cannot accidentally hit the 2.x target. It refuses
  to run if the URL is unset (no default) and aborts unless the server reports
  `1.23`. It creates monitors, so disposable instances only. Not part of the 2.x
  backup → create → cleanup cycle; run it on its own.

## Where changes usually go

- New monitor type / parameter → `_build_monitor_data` and validation in
  `api.py`, the enum in `monitor_type.py`, a matching `MonitorBuilder` setter,
  a v2 unit test, and `docs/api.rst` if a new public class.
- New notification provider → `notification_providers.py` tables + a v2 test.
- New public class/function → export in `__init__.py` **and** add to
  `docs/api.rst` (autodoc won't include it otherwise).

## Never commit

`tests/.env`, `tests/.backups/`, `tests/.live_test_ids.json`, `.temp/`, and
`UPSTREAM_TRIAGE.md` are gitignored and hold secrets or transient state.
