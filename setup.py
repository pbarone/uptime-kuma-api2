# An inherited `setup.py publish` shortcut was removed here. It ran
# `rm dist/*`, `python setup.py sdist` and `twine upload dist/*`, which uploaded
# a locally built artifact straight to PyPI -- bypassing the tag/__version__
# check, `twine check`, and `scripts/check_sdist.py`. That made it the one path
# by which a stale `*.egg-info/SOURCES.txt` could publish `tests/.env` and the
# credential-bearing `tests/.backups/**` snapshots, since a local build reads
# that stale manifest while CI's fresh checkout cannot. It was also broken on
# Windows (`rm`). Releases go through the tag-triggered publish workflow, which
# is gated; see the release flow in CONTRIBUTING.md.
